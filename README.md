# Traffic Analysis and Advisory Generation

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing traffic data to generate traffic advisories based on key metrics such as traffic volume, speed, congestion levels, incidents, environmental impact, and public transport usage. It uses various data analysis and visualization techniques to identify high-traffic zones and areas requiring attention for better traffic management.

## Project Details

This project performs the following:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: The raw traffic data is cleaned, processed, and standardized to ensure accurate analysis.
2. **Clustering Analysis**: K-means clustering is used to identify patterns in traffic data, grouping areas with similar traffic characteristics.
3. **Visualization**: Various visualizations such as heatmaps, traffic volume charts, and sunburst charts are created to visually represent traffic trends and pressure points in the city.
4. **Advisory Generation**: Based on the analysis, traffic advisories are generated for different areas, focusing on congestion, incident rates, environmental impact, and public transport usage.

## Features

- **Cluster Analysis**: Using K-means clustering, the traffic data is divided into meaningful clusters, each representing areas with different traffic characteristics.
- **Traffic Visualizations**: Heatmaps, sunburst charts, and other visualizations are created to give an intuitive view of traffic conditions.
- **Advisory Generation**: Traffic advisories are tailored to specific areas, helping in the identification of high-congestion zones, areas with high environmental impact, and the overall traffic efficiency.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The main programming language used for data analysis, processing, and visualization.
- **Libraries**: 
  - `Pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis.
  - `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`: Data visualization.
  - `Scikit-learn`: Machine learning for clustering.
  - `Numpy`: Numerical computations.

## Data Sources

The data used in this project comes from the **Bangalore Traffic Dataset**. It includes metrics on traffic volume, speed, incidents, environmental impact, public transport usage, and more.

## Example Output
**Area**: Koramangala
- Traffic Volume: 25,000 vehicles
- Average Speed: 50 km/h
- Travel Time Index: 1.5
- Congestion Level: 45%
- Incident Reports: Low
- Environmental Impact: Moderate
- Public Transport Usage: 55%

Advisory: Moderate congestion in this area. Consider using alternative routes or public transport during peak hours.
